🎯 Pathfinder: Intelligent Route Optimizer

Pathfinder is an interactive web-based application for visualizing fundamental graph algorithms such as Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS, and Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to build, edit, and analyze graphs in real time.

🔍 Features

- 🎨 Graph Editor
  - Add, move, and delete nodes and edges
  - Support for automatic or manual edge weights
  - Drag-and-drop interaction via canvas

- 🧠 Algorithm Visualizer
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Kruskal’s MST Algorithm

- 📊 Real-Time Results
  - Visual trace of algorithm execution
  - Execution time, visited nodes, and path length
  - Customizable animation speed

- 💾 Data Handling
  - Save/load graph from `.json` files
  - Load example graphs: Grid, Star, Tree, Complete

- 💻 Modern UI
  - Responsive design
  - Clean, collapsible sections
  - Status bar for feedback and hints
